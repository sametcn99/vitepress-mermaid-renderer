# Installation Test

This page contains a simple Mermaid diagram to verify your installation is working correctly.

## Basic Flowchart

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is plugin working?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Great! Try more examples]
    B -- No --> D[Check installation steps]
    C --> E[Visit examples directory]
    D --> F[Review README.md]
```

If you can see an interactive diagram above with zoom and pan controls, the installation was successful!

## Next Steps

1. Check out more examples in the `examples/` directory
2. Read the documentation in the `guide/` directory
3. Try creating your own diagrams!
